                    I applied for a time ago and after completing the assignaments that they sent me,
                    I was asked to go to their company for the final test. When I arrived there, they sat me down in front of
                    a laptop and gave me 25 question. Those 25 questions where versatile. Some were theoretical and text had to be
                    written but more of them were coding questions and code had to be written. The problem was, the entire test was
                    written in Google Documents which is actually plain old Notepad.
                </p>

                <p class="ContentText">
                    Writing code in that format was a nightmare so I
                    decided to make a web application that could be explained as an IDE for writing tests. That way, all companies could
                    have a uniformed web application with which they could test the knowledge of their job applicants.

                    Test suit allows you to create questions in different formats like text, select box, checkbox, radio buttons or code
                    segments, with the set of questions forming a test. It also gives you the ability to assign a test to different users which have different
                    privileges. A user could be created with a sole purpouse of solving one test and nothing else.

                    Tests are assigned to users. Only users that have been assigned to solve a particular test, can
                    solve that test. Therefore, users have to have certain permissions. In a practical example, let's say
                    a developer has applied to one of your job postings. So, you create a new user with <span>test solver</span>
                    permission with which he can only solve a test that you assign to him. If that wasn't so, that developer could
                    just modify that test, delete a question that he doesn't know or just create a new question that he knows.
                    That is not a desirable situation. User permissions prevent users from doing things that they are not supposed
                    to do. For more information on creating tests, go to section

                    There are 3 user permissions:
                    <ul class="ContentList">
                        <li><span class="Important">1.</span> Test solver</li>
                        <li><span class="Important">2.</span> Test creator</li>
                        <li><span class="Important">3.</span> User manager</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p class="ContentText">
                    <span class="Important">Test solver</span> can only solve test. When you create a new user with this permission,
                    think of him as a job applicant. This user could only solve a test that you assign to him.
                </p>

                <p class="ContentText">
                    <span class="Important">Test creator</span> This user can solve and manage tests but cannot manage users.
                </p>

                <p class="ContentText">
                    <span class="Important">User manager</span> This permission is the most allowing. User created with this permission
                    can manage tests (create/solve) and manage users (create/edit). User that was creating when you installed Test suit
                    has this permission.
                </p>

                <p class="ContentText">
                    Choosing a permission a user can have is up to you. If there is a job applicant that you wish to test, best permission
                    for him is test solver. If you have a college in you company that wants to create tests, but you don't want him to manage
                    users, best permission for him is test creator. If you want someone to help you with user managment, best permission is
                    user manager permission but it is better to have only a couple of user managers in test suit.
